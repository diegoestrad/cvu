    <h2>Summary</h2>
        During the summer of 2023, I had the exciting opportunity to work at the Bonafont Distribution Center (CEDIS)<br>
        where I played a key role in the inventory team. <br>
        My primary responsibility was to ensure accuracy and efficiency in product inventory control, which was essential to maintain smooth operational flow and meet market demand. <br>
        During my time at Bonafont, I not only gained practical skills in inventory management, but also developed competencies in teamwork, effective communication and problem solving in a dynamic and results-oriented environment.
